### Hi there 👋


🎓 My name is Rajeev Karuvath, and I'm a graduate student at Rochester Institute of Technology, New York pursuing Masters in Computing Security. 

💻 After working as a Software Developer for 3 years, I got interested in cybersecurity, specifically security engineering and offensive security. I love developing security solutions and automation tooling to make my penetration testing job easier! 

🔒 Currently I'm researching passwordless authentication schemas, SCADA security & IAM.
